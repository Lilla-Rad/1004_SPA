This website is an interactive exploration game intended to address themes of burnout and perfectionism. It tracks the player's name, playtime, and high score, as well as the amount of levels they've completed. The site includes a fill-in-the-blank minigame that can be replayed endlessly to provide an easy, if not grating, gameplay loop. The game "ends" once the player has explored all aspects of the site, at which point it outputs their statistics. Player information is stored using JSON, and is wiped upon refresh to allow for replayability. Game assets are stock images and audio, adjusted slightly to suit the project's needs.
